As usual, this repo has an empty master branch.  Please see specific branches for specific versions.  This repo is based on the official [Couchbase Docker repo](https://github.com/couchbase/docker), but instead of using CentOS, this uses the Phusion base image, which is based on Ubuntu.  For us, this makes a more consistent set of infrastructure and allows for ssh and logging services to be setup.
